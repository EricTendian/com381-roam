The goal of the app is to
encourage users to walk more by creating walking routes that pass users
by cultural or otherwise interesting points. The idea is to take Google
walking directions and tweak them so that users walk past something they
want to learn more about (i.e.: the Sears tower, a historical museum,
place where a random celebrity died in the '70's, etc.). The walking
routes mimic an ethnographic experience for users within an area.
Cultural points also have descriptions within the app so users can learn
more about a particular landmark. Users also accumulate points based on
their steps taken, and the points are shared via social networking
plugins. Users who obtain certain thresholds of points are then allowed
to input descriptions of "non-conventional" landmarks, such as their own
homes or places of personal significance.
