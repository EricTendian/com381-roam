### Usability Test

We use our personas to recruit for the usability test.

Contained to IIT campus
have a GoPro on them to track interaction with app (if they don't want a camera on their head we can follow them around)
Have separate, higher quality mic for recording thinkaloud (must be able to handle wind noise)

Features to test:

- overlay recognition
- app navigation
- app GPS
- step/distance tracking
- social networking
- points system

Tasks:

1. Set start point at Stuart Building, end point IIT Tower; one route available; go to each point shown on the route; earns them 40 points
2. For one point they post a status update on Facebook from our app, while they are at the point; earns them 10 points
3. they should have 50 points after they complete first two tasks, then they create their own POI (Point of Interest)

To evaluate success:

1. No Success/Failed
2. Succeeded with major errors
3. Succeeded with minor errors
4. Perfect

Do thinkaloud and we are not timing b/c thinkaloud would add additional time
