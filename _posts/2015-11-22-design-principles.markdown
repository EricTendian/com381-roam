There is now downside to missing an item. Large "range" of acceptable and ocerride to automatically popup info. Download content to phone so not dependent on data and wifi.

### 80/20 Rule

20% of our usage would be the most frequent tourist locations in an area, so develeopment should go towards that.

### Accessibility

Text and audio. AUdio of the area with a description.

### Iconic Representation

Icons to represent areas of interest on map.

### Consistency

Similar look and feel to Google Maps
